This includes copying all or pieces of another student work and representing it as your own. Plagiarism will also lead to the student’s submission of the applicable work being invalidated. If students are including other people’s work in submissions e.g. passages from books or websites, then reference should be made to the source. For further information on what constitutes plagiarism please refer to: <a href="http://www.plagiarism.org/">http://www.plagiarism.org/</a> and refer to the Plagiarism policy of CEA.

							<li>CEA will make it clear to students that external appeals process is to consider whether the registered provider has followed its policies and procedures, rather than make a decision in place of the institution. For example, if an overseas student appeals against his or her subject results and goes through the registered provider’s internal appeals process, the external appeals process would look at the way in which the internal appeal was conducted; it would not make a determination as to what the subject result should be.</p></li>

						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<ul class="list no-margin" style="padding-left: 30px;">

This may include advice, discussions, meeting with the complainant, emails and general mediation in relation to the issue. Any staff member can be involved in this informal process to resolve issues, but once a complainant has placed a formal complaint / appeal, the following procedures must be followed. </p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">If a complainant is uncomfortable in speaking directly to the person involved or the informal process does not resolve the issue to the complainant’s satisfaction, the formal process should be followed as described later on in the document.</p>

							<li>The division of the expenses associated with the mediation e.g. mediator’s fee, room hire and possibly travel expenses are to be shared equally between CEA and the complainant / appellant.</li>
							<li>CEA will immediately implement recommendations arising from the external review within at least 10 working days of the receipt of the recommendations.</li>
							<li>If a student or stakeholder are still dissatisfied with the decision of CEA, they may wish to seek advice or make a complaint about CEA to ASQA directly. If, after CEA’s internal complaints and appeals processes have been completed, and they still believe CEA is breaching or has breached its legal requirements, they can submit a complaint to ASQA by completing the “The Complaint about a training organisation operating under ASQA’s jurisdiction” form. While ASQA will not be able to act as their advocate, the lodgement of their complaint will inform ASQA’s risk assessment of CEA and a complaint audit may be conducted.</li>

						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">When  a  complaint  is  received,  an assessment  is  first  made  about whether it  is  an  issue  that  the Ombudsman can investigate. In some cases, the Ombudsman may decide not to investigate a complaint.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">This might be because:</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 5px;"></div>
						<ul class="list no-margin" style="padding-left: 30px;">
							<li>the student has not complained to the education provider first, or</li>
							<li>another organisation is better able to deal with the complaint</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">If a decision is made to investigate a complaint, the Ombudsman will ask the education provider about the problem. The Ombudsman may request relevant documents, or information such as student records from the provider.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">The Ombudsman can use formal powers to obtain documents from the provider. The Ombudsman also has the power to enter premises or require a provider to answer questions as part of an investigation.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">Standard 8.4 of the Code requires that the registered provider must maintain the student's enrolment while the complaints and appeals process is ongoing. This means that the provider must maintain the student's enrolment (i.e. not report the student for unsatisfactory progress or attendance) until the external complaints process is complete and has supported the provider's decision to report.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">The Ombudsman will notify the provider when it commences an external complaint and appeal process and when this process is completed. However, if the student lodges an external appeal outside the provider's stated timeframe for reply, then CEA has the right to report the student.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">The provisions of standard 8.5 also still apply, which means that if the Ombudsman's investigation results in a decision that supports the student, the CEA must immediately implement any decision and/or corrective    and    preventative    action    required    and    advise    the    student    of    the    outcome.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;"><span class="proximanova-bold">Outline of Fees</span></p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">At the end of an investigation the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider has not acted unreasonably, and will advise the student and the provider of this decision.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">In other cases, the Ombudsman may conclude that the provider failed to take appropriate action or the action appears to have been:</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 5px;"></div>
						<ul class="list no-margin" style="padding-left: 30px;">
							<li>contrary to law</li>
							<li>unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory or</li>
							<li>otherwise, in all the circumstances, wrong</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">Where that happens, the Ombudsman may recommend that a provider remedy the problem for example by:</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 5px;"></div>
						<ul class="list no-margin" style="padding-left: 30px;">
							<li>apologising to a student</li>
							<li>reconsidering a decision affecting a student</li>
							<li>providing a refund </li>
							<li>providing clearer information or</li>
							<li>changing a policy or procedure.</li>

						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;"><span class="proximanova-bold">AMENDING/CHANGING YOUR ENROLMENT:</span> After    completing    the enrolment, a student might have the need to change his/her enrolment due to   ‘change   of   mind’   or   for   other   reasons.   International   students   are precluded from suspending studies due to student visa conditions. Students must contact the Student Support team to discuss options. They will be able to advise students whether or not they are permitted to withdraw from their current course and switch to another course and how it will affect their visa, as this will affect the normal course duration and may require the student to obtain a new student visa to cover the remaining period before the current visa expires. The student’s OSHC may need to be extended as well to cover the extended course duration and new student visa.</p>

						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">In consideration of a student’s compassionate or compelling circumstances, CEA may defer, suspend or cancel a student’s enrolment. Compassionate or compelling circumstances are  generally  those  beyond the control of the student and which have an impact upon  the  student’s course progress or wellbeing. When determining whether compassionate or compelling circumstances exist, the College considers documentary evidence provided to support the claim, and stores copies of these documents in the student’s file.</p>
						<div class="clearfix" style="height: 10px;"></div>
						<p class="px-14-font text-justify" style="line-height: 14px;">Students may also have their enrolment suspended or cancelled by the College due to non-payment of fees, unsatisfactory course progress, misbehaviour or breaching the College Code of Conduct. The student will be advised that his/her student visa maybe affected if his/her enrolment is deferred, suspended or cancelled.

The CEA delegate will arrange a time to meet with students who are not progressing satisfactorily and ascertain the reasons for this. Access to appropriate supports services will then be provided to assist the student in successfully completing their course within the scheduled duration. Community Education Australia may refer students to external sources if they are unable to sufficiently provide support for students learning needs. Community Education Australia may refer students to external organisations if they are experiencing personal/welfare issues that are affecting their course progress. Community Education Australia takes all reasonable and feasible steps to assist students so they can successfully complete their course within the course schedule. It is a requirement of the National Code of Practice 2018 Standard 8 that the College reports students who do not achieve satisfactory course progress over study period. This can lead to your student visa may be cancelled. Please contact the college at info@Communityeducation.edu.au or visit the website to see Student Support Policy and Procedure for further details on how your course progress may impact your student visa.
